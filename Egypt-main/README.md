# This is my attempt to create a UI-UX design 

This Project consists of a UI-UX design for a tourism and knowledge website for egypt. Being my first step to UI-UX design I require some help in the javascript of this website if you could please help me out. Cheers!
## The Demo of working page

This is how the page looks like when in function

![Egypt-pyramids-Google-Chrome-202](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71783722/128968773-021dbadf-6e0c-4019-95dc-10ce2f94e9d4.gif)
## FAQ

#### Languages Used

Html, CSS 

### What problems I am having with this ?

I want this website to have that learnmore section not visible till the time it is not hover or targeted. That should be below the Land of Phorahs section.

Sound is also one of the issues which I am facing. I wish to trigger an auto enable sound loop that would autoplay when the website is clicked.
